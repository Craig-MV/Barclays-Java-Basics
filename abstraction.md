## Abstraction

Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential features they possess, while hiding the unnecessary details.

Let's use a real-world analogy to explain abstraction:

Imagine you are driving a car. While driving, you are aware of the basic operations like accelerating, braking, and turning the steering wheel. However, you don't need to know the intricate details of how the engine, transmission, or braking system works. This is an example of abstraction, where you focus on the essential aspects and hide the complex inner workings.

Now, let's represent this concept in Java:

```java
// Abstract class representing a vehicle
abstract class Vehicle {
    // Abstract method representing the basic movement
    public abstract void move();

    // Concrete method shared by all vehicles
    public void honk() {
        System.out.println("Honk! Honk!");
    }
}

// Concrete class representing a Car
class Car extends Vehicle {
    // Implementing the abstract method for Car
    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Car is moving");
    }

    // Additional methods specific to Car can be added here
}

// Concrete class representing a Bicycle
class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
    // Implementing the abstract method for Bicycle
    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Bicycle is moving");
    }

    // Additional methods specific to Bicycle can be added here
}
```

Explanation:

- The **Vehicle** class is an abstract class. It contains an abstract method **move()** that represents the basic movement of any vehicle. It also has a concrete method **honk()** that is shared by all vehicles.
- The **Car** and **Bicycle** classes are concrete classes that extend the abstract class **Vehicle**. They must provide an implementation for the abstract method **move()**. Additionally, they can have their own specific methods.

In this example, the abstract class **Vehicle** serves as a blueprint that enforces a basic structure for all vehicles. Concrete classes like **Car** and **Bicycle** provide specific implementations for the abstract method **move()**. As a programmer, when using these classes, you can focus on the essential behavior (like **move()**), and the complex details are hidden within the classes themselves.

This is an example of abstraction, where you model classes based on the essential features and hide the unnecessary details, making the system easier to understand and use.
