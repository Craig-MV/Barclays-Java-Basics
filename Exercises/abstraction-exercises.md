## Exercise 1: Shape Hierarchy

Create an abstraction for geometric shapes. Define an abstract class **Shape** with an abstract method **calculateArea()**. Implement two classes, **Circle** and **Rectangle**, that extend the **Shape** class and provide their own implementations for calculating the area.

## Exercise 2: Animal Hierarchy

Create an abstraction for animals. Define **Animal** with methods like **makeSound()** and **move()**. Implement two classes, **Dog** and **Bird**, that extend the **Animal** and provide their own implementations for making sounds and moving.

## Exercise 3: Banking System

Create an abstraction for a banking system. Define an abstract class **Account** with methods **deposit()** and **withdraw()**. Implement two classes, **SavingsAccount** and **CheckingAccount**, that extend the **Account** class and provide their own implementations for depositing and withdrawing money.
