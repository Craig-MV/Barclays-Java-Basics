## Introduction

Before attempting these exercises you will need to research **Overloading**, **Overriding** and **Runtime Polymorphism**.

## Exercise 1: Method Overloading

Create a class called **Calculator** with method for **addition**. Implement methods for **adding two integers**, **two doubles**, and **two strings**. Demonstrate method overloading by calling each version of the method.

## Exercise 2: Method Overriding

Create a class called **Shape** with an abstract method **calculateArea()**. Implement two classes, **Circle** and **Rectangle**, that extend the **Shape** class and provide their own implementations for calculating the area.

## Exercise 3: Runtime Polymorphism

Create a class called **Animal** with a method **makeSound()**. Implement two classes, **Dog** and **Cat**, that override the **makeSound()** method. Demonstrate runtime polymorphism by creating an array of Animal objects and calling the **makeSound()** method for each.
