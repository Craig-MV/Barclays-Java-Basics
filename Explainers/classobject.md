## Classes and Objects

### Class
**Definition**: A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating **objects**. It defines the properties(**attributes**) and behaviors (**methods**) that objects of that class will have.

**Example**: If we think of a class **Car**, it would describe what every car should have, like make, model, and methods for driving.

```java
// Example class definition
class Car {
    String make;
    String model;

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("The car is moving.");
    }
}
```

### Object 
**Definition**: An **object** is an **instance** of a **class**. It's a concrete realisation of the blueprint defined by the class.

**Example**: An object of class **Car** could be a specific car, like a "Toyota Corolla".

```java
// Creating an object (instance) of the Car class
Car myCar = new Car();
```

### Instance and Instantiation
#### Instance
**Definition**: An instance is a specific occurrence of an object. It represents a unique copy of the class, with its own set of data.

**Example**: If **myCar** is an instance of the **Car** class, it would be a unique car with its own make, model, and specific behaviors.

#### Instantiation
**Definition**: Instantiation is the process of creating an instance of a class. It involves allocating memory and initializing the object.

**Example**: When we do **new Car()**, we are instantiating a new **Car** object. It's like bringing a new car into existence.

### Putting it All Together in a Java Example
```java
// Define a simple class
class Car {
    String make;
    String model;

    // Method to drive the car
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("The " + make + " " + model + " is moving.");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate classes and objects
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Instantiate an object (create an instance) of the Car class
        Car myCar = new Car();

        // Set the properties of the car
        myCar.make = "Toyota";
        myCar.model = "Corolla";

        // Accessing properties and methods of the instance
        System.out.println("Make: " + myCar.make);
        System.out.println("Model: " + myCar.model);
        myCar.drive(); // Calls the drive method of the Car class
    }
}
```
In this example:

- We define a **Car** class with properties **make** and **model** and a method **drive**.
- In the **Main** class, we instantiate a **Car** object named **myCar** using new **Car()**;.
- We set the properties of **myCar** and call its **drive** method.

This is a simplified example, but it demonstrates the basics of classes, objects, instances, and instantiation in Java. Think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects, and objects as specific instances of that blueprint with their own unique characteristics.
